# GESTURE-VOLUME-CONTROL
This is my python project where you can control the volume of your pc by the gesture of your hand only.

REQUIREMENTS: A CAMERA CONNECT TO YOUR COMPUTER 

This is a machine learning project whis is divided in to two parts.
PART 1: Here we have created a module with python that will track our hands not control the volume.
PART 2: Here we have imported the module we created in PART 1 so that while tracking the hands we can add extra function to control the volume.


THE MAIN REASON FOR STORING THE PART 1 AS A MODULE BECAUSE IT ACTS AS A CORE AND WITH THAT MANY HIGH LEVEL PROJECTS CAN BE CREATED WHICH I WILL BE UPLOADING AFTER THIS PROJECT
HAVE A GOOD REACH;

****### NOTE ###****  -----> This uses only your cpu power so if you don't have a dedicated or good gpu it will not affect it's performance.
